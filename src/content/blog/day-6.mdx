import ContentImage from '../../components/general/ContentImage.astro';

## Purpose

To document my [#100DaysofCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge for 2024, currently focused on building a professional profile using [Astro](https://astro.build/).

## Task List

- swap top-left "home" button logo with crossinguard.dev text
- add resume
- update README

### Home button

Since I included the font Lazer84 in my assets and already created the font family in CSS, I went ahead and did a text-based home button. That means I just turned the original #H2 header using `SITE_DESCRIPTION` from my `consts.ts` file back on and the logo back off.

```astro
---
import { SITE_TITLE } from '../consts';
---

<header>
  <nav>
    <!-- <a href="/">
      <span class="sr-only">Home</span>
      <img src="/assets/cg-logo.svg" alt="crossinguard logo" height="50" width="50" class="logo">
    </a> -->
    <h2><a href="/">{SITE_TITLE}</a></h2>
```

I added a glowing hover effect to the logo that we will sit on for a bit and see if we like it.

### Resume

My resume already lives in markdown so adding here should be (knocks on wood) easy.

### README

Replaced the existing template README with a quick description of this website.

## TOODS

- Create new layouts so I can split `.astro` main page layouts from blog post layouts.
