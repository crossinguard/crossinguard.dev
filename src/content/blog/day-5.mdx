## Purpose

To document my [#100DaysofCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge for 2024, currently focused on building a professional profile using [Astro](https://astro.build/).

Let the record show a time jump occured. My intention is to try and code every day, but when I don't I will roll with it and continue on. Set goals, and be kind when you don't meet them.

## Task List

- refine content image component
- remove all lingering blog template content (e.g., placeholder images)
- update favicon to work with all browsers (not showing up on my iPhone)
- fix image on about page

### Fix dates

This isn't on my to do list but I just noticed the dates for my blog posts are 1 day before the actual date. This is likely from the original template wanting dates formatted as "Jan 15 2024" while I have been using the [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) version as "2024-01-15". There is an existing component in `src/components/FormattedDate.astro` that I will tweak for my preferred date format.

Turns out the date was considered to be UTC time zone, a full 8 hours ahead of my time zone in Pacific. Because of this my dates were then converted from UTC to PT (rather than correctly starting in PT), resulting in my dates being a day earlier than intended. I will work on a better solution in the future but for now I simply added 8 hours to my time stamps to account for the time zone conversion.

I also changed the locale to be "en-GB" as I prefer their format of day month year rather than month day year. Size order baby!

### Content image component

The current content image component looks pretty terrible so lets work on updating it. Nothing too drastic, but I removed the slight glow effect, added a visual division between the image and caption, and added a bit more padding. Additionally I returned the caption back to left justified. Also removed the background color on the caption. Was looking too early 2000s web for my taste.

<ContentImage
  src="/assets/100daysofcode/day5/1-new-old-content.png"
  alt="Snapshot of the old content component visible inside the new component"
  caption="Image of the old component within my new version"
/>

### Remove template content

Done. I just deleted the remaining blog placeholder images from `public`.

### Update favicon

While the svg favicon will show up in most cases, it wasn't showing properly on my Apple devices. To make sure I am covered I went ahead and used [realfavicongenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/), another tool I learned about from coder-coder. This tool provides options to personalize how the favicon shows up across the typical desktop and mobile browsers along with iOS, Android, and Safari alterations.

The tool spits out a `.zip` with 14 files all based on my original svg. Those various versions of the favicon were placed in `public`. The tool also indicated what code needed to be added to my `<head>` section.

```html
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/apple-touch-icon.png" />
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/favicon-32x32.png" />
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="/favicon-16x16.png" />
<link rel="manifest" href="/site.webmanifest" />
<link rel="mask-icon" href="/safari-pinned-tab.svg" color="#119da4" />
<meta name="msapplication-TileColor" content="#363636" />
<meta name="theme-color" content="#ffffff" />
```

### Fix About image

Not sure what the issue was with my image as when I ran `npm run build` I received no errors. However, Netlify had build errors once I committed my changes and I had to remove the image. I opened up my image editor, reduced the resolution of my profile picture, and exported back as a `.png` rather than the original `.jpeg`. Side note...wtf is the difference between `.jpg` and `.jpeg`?!?
