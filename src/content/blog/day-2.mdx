## Purpose

To document my [#100DaysofCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge for 2024, currently focused on building a professional profile using [Astro](https://astro.build/).

## Task List

- Customize CSS to use specific fonts and basic style colors
- Update social media links in nav and footer
- Update header and footer information
- Replace "crossinguard.dev" nav text with logo to serve as a home button
- Update favicon

### Customize CSS

#### Fonts

The blog template included default fonts within `public/fonts`, making use of Atkinson. This is confirmed by looking at `src/styles/global.css` where we can see Atkinson brought in using `@font-face` and assigned to the `body` styling.

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Atkinson';
  src: url('/fonts/atkinson-regular.woff') format('woff');
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
}
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Atkinson';
  src: url('/fonts/atkinson-bold.woff') format('woff');
  font-weight: 700;
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
}
body {
  font-family: 'Atkinson', sans-serif;
}
```

While I originally planned to use a different font, the more I looked into Atkinson the more intersted I was. As a form math teacher I have felt the struggles with differentiating 1 from l from L, along with 0 from O. I decided to stick with Atkinson as my default font [based on its emphasis on legibility and readability for low vision readers](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont). Nice call default blog template!

I next brought the font I have been using for my branding: [Lazer 84](https://sunrise-digital.net/font.html). This font is purely decorative and quite the opposite of Atkinson when it comes to readability. This will be used sparingly, typically in the form of svgs or large headings.

I used [transfonter.org](https://transfonter.org/) to convert my `.ttf` font into `.woff` and `.woff2` and generate my css to add into my global styles. I barely undestand the difference between these font types but this was a tool I learned from one of my courses (coder-coder?) and it has treated me right so far!

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'lazer84';
  src: url('lazer84.woff2') format('woff2'), url('lazer84.woff') format('woff');
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
}
```

<span style="font-family: 'lazer84', monospace;">
  This is an example of text in the "Lazer 84" font. Fun 80s vibe but not very
  legible...just like my hand writting!
</span>

#### Colors

I next brought in a set of themed colors I plan to use on this site, intending to replace most of the existing colors in the template's css.

![color palette with 5 colors: orange, white, black, teal, and gray](/assets/100daysofcode/day2/1-palette.png)
_[1] orange: #bf4e30, light: #f2f2f2, dark: #171717, teal: #119da4, gray: #363636_

Updating colors was a bit tricky with many already in use throughout template components. I set my base colors and attempted to redirect existing color variables to these new colors.

```css
:root {
  --dark: #171717;
  --gray: #363636;
  --light: #f2f2f2;
  --teal: #119da4;
  --orange: #bf4e30;
  --accent: var(--orange);
  --gray-light: lighten(var(--gray), 20%);
  --gray-dark: darken(var(--gray), 20%);
  --gray-gradient: red;
}
```

### Social Media, Header, Footer

I am not much of a social media user, so I wanted to change the icons to ones I actually use. In the `Header.astro` and `Footer.astro` components there are social media icons. This seems like a great application of an Astro component (i.e., reusable chunk of code). By making a `Social.astro` component, I could make updates to the social media section in both the header and footer without duplicating my code between the two locations. This is one of the core ideas of Astro!

I copy/pasted the div `.social-links` from `Header.astro`, along with accompanying styles, into my new component `src/components.Social.astro`. I then replaced the relevant code chunks in the header and footer to make use of this component. One update location now affects both areas.

### Home Logo

Time to replace "crossinguard.dev" with my logo to act as the home button! I moved into `Header.astro` and replaced the `{SITE_TITLE}` with an SVG logo, using "Home" as the alt text.

### Favicon

To end day 2, I updated the favicon from the default Astro logo to my own logo used as the home button above. This was as simple as moving my desired svg favicon into `public`, replacing the existing file by having the same name.

## TOODS

- Make color changes throughout all pages to reflect new CSS color options
- Futher customize header and footer colors and links
- Change home page to be custom content
- Customize nav. Astro is warning me that my icon used as a home button is causing accessibility concerns.
