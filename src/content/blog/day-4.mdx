## Purpose

To document my [#100DaysofCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge for 2024, currently focused on building a professional profile using [Astro](https://astro.build/).

## Task List

- Create a component to deal with images and figcaption for use in my blog posts
- Customize About page
- Investigate inconsistent jitter when hovering over hero titles

### ~Hero~ Fix Jittering

Yup, I started off by ignoring my task list and playing around with my hero a bit more. I wanted a little interactivity on my logo home button in the header so added an opacity hover effect. Additionall I added a hover effect so it highlights my middle name. I have gone by my middle name my entire life and this seemed like a fun way to call that out.

Additionally, I removed the slight skew effect when hovering over my titles under my name. Something about "data analyst" was causing some janky stuttering during the transition. Looks like I accidentally got a task list item done!

### Image Component

There is a built-in Image component as part of astro. However, I want my own verison to allow custom styling and figure captioning when using images inside of my markdown documents. Time to take better advantage of the `.mdx` files we chose on day 1. And by "we" I mean "me". Just me here...

I created a new component `src/components/ContentImage.astro` and followed the basic examples in the [Astro components documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/), setting up props for `src`, `alt`, and `caption`.

Here is my same image used in the prior section with the existing image handling.

And here is the same image using my new component.

<ContentImage
  src="/assets/100daysofcode/day4/1-brett-hover.png"
  alt="'William Brett Egbert' with a teal wavy line above Brett"
  caption="This is my caption"
/>

I will keep playing around with this but for now it exists, functions correctly, and that seems great.

### Customize About Page

I recently updated the "About" description on my LinkedIn page so I am going to be lazy and reuse that here. This section will get a better glow up as we go along but this will at least get rid of the last of the template content. I added a quick picture of myself and this great photo of the region where I live.

<ContentImage
  src="/assets/100daysofcode/day4/2-sumas.jpg"
  alt="Tree covered mountains in northern Washington state"
  caption="Photo by Justin Cron"
/>

_Dear future me: something about this image is causing the build to fail, image temporarily removed_

## TOODS

- refine content image component
- remove all lingering blog template content (e.g., placeholder images)
- update favicon to work with all browsers (not showing up on my iPhone)
- fix image on about page
