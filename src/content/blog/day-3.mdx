## Purpose

To document my [#100DaysofCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge for 2024, currently focused on building a professional profile using [Astro](https://astro.build/).

## Task List

- Make color changes throughout all pages to reflect new CSS color options
- Futher customize header and footer colors and links
- Change home page to be custom content
- Customize nav. Astro is warning me that my icon used as a home button is causing accessibility concerns.

### Color Changes

I set up my new CSS colors yesterday and did a scrappy job linking them to existing components. To start cleaning things up I split my css with `src/styles` into `global.css`, `fonts.css`, and `colors.css`. Additionally, I went ahead and added a `reset.css` to incorporate [Josh Comeau's custom css reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/#our-finished-product-10). Each `.css` sheet is imported into my `BaseHead.astro` component so should apply to all pages/components globally. Any specific styling will happen directly within the file for that page/component.

There are likely conflicts between the reset, colors, and existing stylings provided by the blog template so I will work to resolve those across the coming days as I make this template my own.

Eventually I want multiple color themes (light, dark) so users can view my page with their own preferences, but for now I am focusing on a dark theme. To kick today off I
went through `global.css` and removed any color use beyond having a dark background and a light text color. Additionally, I went ahead and created lighter versions of my accent colors that would have better contrast with a dark background. I used [WebAIM's constrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to ensure my lighter accent colors had a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text against my dark color.

```css
:root {
  --dark: #171717;
  --light: #f2f2f2;
  --gray: #363636;
  --gray-light: #a3a3a3;
  --teal: #119da4;
  --teal-light: #15c2cb;
  --orange: #bf4e30;
  --orange-light: #de927c;
}
```

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center;">
  <div style="height: 100px; width: 150px; text-align: center; background-color: var(--orange);">
    `orange`
  </div>

{' '}

<div style="height: 100px; width: 150px; text-align: center; background-color: var(--orange-light);">
  `orange-light`
</div>

{' '}

<div style="height: 100px; width: 150px; text-align: center; background-color: var(--gray);">
  `gray`
</div>

{' '}

<div style="height: 100px; width: 150px; text-align: center; background-color: var(--gray-light);">
  `gray-light`
</div>

{' '}

<div style="height: 100px; width: 150px; text-align: center; background-color: var(--teal);">
  `teal`
</div>

  <div style="height: 100px; width: 150px; text-align: center; background-color: var(--teal-light);">
    `teal-light`
  </div>
</div>

After changing any existing color properties used in `global.css` to my new light, dark, and adjusted accent colors I started digging into the existing components, ensuring only my defined colors were used. This included adjustments to the following components that had existing styles based on the original template:

- `src/pages/blog/index.astro`
- `src/layouts/BlogPost.astro`
- `src/components/Social.astro`
- `src/components/Header.astro`
- `src/components/Footer.astro`

### Home Page

The home page will eventually house my professional profile and serve as a landing page for potential employers/clients. For now I am removing the template content and replacing with my crossinguard.dev branding and a few hero-like elements to identify this space as my own. I decided to place these pieces into `src/components/Hero.astro` in case I reused this later on.

![Template home page with placeholder text](/assets/100daysofcode/day3/1-home-before.png)
_[1] Hello, Original Template_

![New home page with crossinguard branding](/assets/100daysofcode/day3/2-home-after.png)
_[2] The hero crossinguard emerges_

In order to minimize media queries on the text elements of the hero, I made use of the [Clamp Calculator](https://royalfig.github.io/fluid-typography-calculator/), a fluid typography calculator.

### Navigation

I am generally in for the way the navigation looks (having removed the social tags from the header) but want it more confined to the middle since it looks a bit rediculous on wide screens.

Additionally, Astro was warning me that my logo home link needed text in order to be accessible. This is a redundant button with the "Home" button present in the navigation so I added text for a screen reader that is not displayed visually by adding a span: `<span class="sr-only">Home</span>`.

## TOODS

- Create a component to deal with images and figcaption for use in my blog posts
- Customize About page
- Investigate inconsistent jitter when hovering over hero titles
