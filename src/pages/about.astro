	<p>I am an educator and tech-curious developer obsessed with the belief that things worth knowing shouldn't be miserable to learn. My idea of a good time is breaking content down into digestible pieces and obsessing over phrasing, formatting, and methods of presentation.</p>

	<p>As an educator, I have designed, iterated, & redesigned hundreds of math lessons with original supporting instructional materials in alignment with high level content requirements. At both the secondary and university level I have extensive experience in defining technical knowledge targets & key skills associated within a knowledge domain, and crafting assessments laser focused on measuring that competency.</p>

	<p>As a developer I have used SQL, R, and Python for both ad-hoc data investigations and established database queries, along with business intelligence dashboard creation (e.g., Tableau, PowerBI). Creating R Markdown data reports ended up being my gateway drug into frontend web development where I am currently expanding my skill set.</p>

	<p>I bask in the overlapping Venn diagram of math ed, data analytics, and frontend web development.</p>
